# PL JAM #1

## OVERVIEW

The #language-makers programming language jam is a

- low key
- small scope
- max creativity

opportunity to hack on a programming language.

## THEME

<s>_The Theme will be announced on Monday, June 2_</s>

The theme is

### The end is not the end

Does `end` refer to syntax, to program execution, developer experience, or
something else? You decide! Be as literal or figurative as you want.

## SCHEDULE

### Week 1 (Monday, June 2 - Monday, June 9): design doc

Week #1 is primarily for thinking deeply and writing ideas down. This could
include

- description
- inspiration
- novel features
- example syntax

it must include an explanation of how your PL connects to the jam theme.

Please add a link to your design doc in the jam
[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hMbn1yasJq2BBzXpGA2jyMc5fLPXVuCExAvhTmsQIE0/edit?usp=sharing).
We accept any reasonable format including github READMEs and google docs.

### Week 2 (Monday, June 9 - Monday, June 16): implementation

In week #2 take a swing at implementing a runtime, interpreter, compiler, or
transpiler for your language. Compilers can take decades to write so nobody is
expecting the next python -- even getting a single contrived program to run is a
huge accomplishment.

### Rules

- PL must be original
  - please do not submit a PL you already made or started
- PL must adhere to theme
  - include an explanation of how your PL fits the theme in the design doc
- Submission must include at least 1 sample program with **clear steps about how
  to run it**
- You may work in teams

### Awards ceremony

While the judges deliberate we encourage everyone to explore all the submissions
-- no prize is better than having people try your language! At the end of the
week we'll have a video call where we'll announce the winning language and
prizes!
